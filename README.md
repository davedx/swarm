Swarm
=====

Swarm is a declarative BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) framework built on top of jasmine-node [1] and zombie.js [2].

I found jasmine was great for writing unit / functional / integration tests, but for BDD I really liked the style of writing scenarios and features as plain text in a declarative language - to me this is the essence of BDD, bridging the gap between non-technical stakeholders or analysts who know **what they want**, and developers, who know **how to test it for it**.

At the moment it's just a prototype that only allows selecting from drop down menus and testing the result.

Because of zombie, testing outcomes is pretty complete already.

I'll update this document when I've added more parse options.
